This is a simple chatbot application built using Flask and a custom response function. The application serves as an interactive chatbot that processes user input and provides responses using a pre-defined get_response function.
User-friendly Interface: A clean and simple front-end (HTML) where users can interact with the chatbot.

Custom Response Logic: The chatbot responds to user input with dynamic replies based on the get_response function.

API Endpoint: A /get_response endpoint that processes user messages and returns chatbot replies as JSON.
